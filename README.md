🍻 Tusker-na-Muziki
Welcome to Tusker-na-Muziki—where trivia meets tunes and culture flows like cold lager on a sunny afternoon. This interactive experience blends the bold flavor of Tusker Lager with the rhythm of Kenyan music, inviting users to test their knowledge and share the soundtrack to their week.

🧠 Trivia Time: Challenge yourself with fun, culturally rich questions about Kenya—its history, slang, pop culture, and more. Whether you're a trivia champ or just vibing, there's something for everyone.

🎶 What's Your Jam? Each week, users can drop the song they’re currently jamming to. These tracks form our Tusker-na-Muziki Playlist—a crowd-curated mix of feel-good hits, underground gems, and nostalgic throwbacks.
